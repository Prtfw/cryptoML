"bitcoin 's potential includes : 1 ) banking the unbanked 2 ) a reliable store of value 3 ) fast , cheap transactions without surveillance 4 ) ... and much more there 's obviously still a lot of work to be done. bitcoin does n't do all this yet. but , as the price shows , enough people with money see the potential and want to be a part of it . our banking system is centralized , regulated and innovation must be approved by regulators , central bankers and politicians. as such , the extent of innovation we see in banking is the slow rollout of compromises between regulators and companies that do n't mind being regulated. costs are high , a huge percentage of the world 's population remains unbanked , bankers are incredibly wealthy , and the rest of us are forced to take tremendous risk to try to not have our wealth and earnings destroyed through inflation , recession or financial crisis . bitcoin is , generally , ungoverned. it is an open source project that any developer can contribute to and that anyone can choose to participate in by running a node , purchasing bitcoins , transacting with bitcoin , mining , etc.... and this is working out fine. there are incredibly exciting , unregulated innovations coming that amazing developers are working on . there are those in the cryptocurrency space who do not care whether bitcoin 's potential is realized. some of them seek wealth and power and are prepared to sacrifice these goals to achieve personal wealth and power . there is a group of powerful companies in bitcoin now that are trying to centralize bitcoin under their control. this is called segwit2x. these companies have cloned the bitcoin code repository and banned many individuals and developers from contributing or commenting on their copy of it , and there is only one developer now making code commitments. to suggest that this is a power grab by a mediocre developer and misguided companies is an understatement considering how important and valuable bitcoin actually is . when it is this easy to identify who is in control , it will also be easy and tempting to regulate bitcoin. and , regulation is a form of censorship. and if this happens all those potential benefits of bitcoin go out the window. many of these companies behind the takeover have openly called for the regulation of bitcoin . we are at an important fork in the road in history. to one side leads a future in which the potential innovation above will become a reality. to the other side is the status quo . whatever happens with segwit2x though , bitcoin 's spirit and potential can not actually be stopped. because it is a consensus system , we simply need to not run segwit2x * * and * * run something that segwit2x does n't break , while economically supporting the decentralized , unregulated and uncensored bitcoin. the really shifty thing segwit2x is attempting to do is to undermine how bitcoin clients work and prevent bitcoin 's chain from growing or to fool wallets into following the segwit2x chain. in a regulated environment what these people are doing would be called fraud and the would be arrested and imprisoned for it. but there is ambiguity in trust-less systems and we have to protect ourselves instead of relying on authorities because authorities will protect us from innovation too , unfortunately . i expect that segwit2x will fail - that it will fall apart before or shortly after it activates because it lacks the support of true participants and advocates for bitcoin. but if the attackers remain committed to it and come at bitcoin with a combination of simultaneous attacks that do make it challenging for bitcoin 's current code base to progress , we will need a hard fork of our own. that will in a very real sense be a security upgrade to halt this attack and to allow the chain and code that is decentralized , unregulated and uncensored to continue to develop . it is precisely for this reason - that we can stop the takeover with a hard fork - that i expect the attackers to abandon their takeover attempt. but history does show that greed and power lust can cloud judgment , so i do n't think it 's a certainty . let 's watch and see. let 's hope for the best , but know we are prepared for the worst . if you want to do anything to try to send a message and to ensure your security throughout this , as always : run a full node and store your coins at addresses to which * * only you have the private keys * * ; speak out against segwit2x ; write to the segwit2x supporters to let them know they are making a mistake and that they do not have your support .",78072a,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508678973,logical,6,0,8354,10178,0

"bitcoin 's potential includes : 1 ) banking the unbanked 2 ) a reliable store of value 3 ) fast , cheap transactions without surveillance 4 ) ... and much more there 's obviously still a lot of work to be done. bitcoin does n't do all this yet. but , as the price shows , enough people with money see the potential and want to be a part of it . our banking system is centralized , regulated and innovation must be approved by regulators , central bankers and politicians. as such , the extent of innovation we see in banking is the slow rollout of compromises between regulators and companies that do n't mind being regulated. costs are high , a huge percentage of the world 's population remains unbanked , bankers are incredibly wealthy , and the rest of us are forced to take tremendous risk to try to not have our wealth and earnings destroyed through inflation , recession or financial crisis . bitcoin is , generally , ungoverned. it is an open source project that any developer can contribute to and that anyone can choose to participate in by running a node , purchasing bitcoins , transacting with bitcoin , mining , etc.... and this is working out fine. there are incredibly exciting , unregulated innovations coming that amazing developers are working on . there are those in the cryptocurrency space who do not care whether bitcoin 's potential is realized. some of them seek wealth and power and are prepared to sacrifice these goals to achieve personal wealth and power . there is a group of powerful companies in bitcoin now that are trying to centralize bitcoin under their control. this is called segwit2x. these companies have cloned the bitcoin code repository and banned many individuals and developers from contributing or commenting on their copy of it , and there is only one developer now making code commitments. to suggest that this is a power grab by a mediocre developer and misguided companies is an understatement considering how important and valuable bitcoin actually is . when it is this easy to identify who is in control , it will also be easy and tempting to regulate bitcoin. and , regulation is a form of censorship. and if this happens all those potential benefits of bitcoin go out the window. many of these companies behind the takeover have openly called for the regulation of bitcoin . we are at an important fork in the road in history. to one side leads a future in which the potential innovation above will become a reality. to the other side is the status quo . whatever happens with segwit2x though , bitcoin 's spirit and potential can not actually be stopped. because it is a consensus system , we simply need to not run segwit2x * * and * * run something that segwit2x does n't break , while economically supporting the decentralized , unregulated and uncensored bitcoin. the really shifty thing segwit2x is attempting to do is to undermine how bitcoin clients work and prevent bitcoin 's chain from growing or to fool wallets into following the segwit2x chain. in a regulated environment what these people are doing would be called fraud and the would be arrested and imprisoned for it. but there is ambiguity in trust-less systems and we have to protect ourselves instead of relying on authorities because authorities will protect us from innovation too , unfortunately . i expect that segwit2x will fail - that it will fall apart before or shortly after it activates because it lacks the support of true participants and advocates for bitcoin. but if the attackers remain committed to it and come at bitcoin with a combination of simultaneous attacks that do make it challenging for bitcoin 's current code base to progress , we will need a hard fork of our own. that will in a very real sense be a security upgrade to halt this attack and to allow the chain and code that is decentralized , unregulated and uncensored to continue to develop . it is precisely for this reason - that we can stop the takeover with a hard fork - that i expect the attackers to abandon their takeover attempt. but history does show that greed and power lust can cloud judgment , so i do n't think it 's a certainty . let 's watch and see. let 's hope for the best , but know we are prepared for the worst . if you want to do anything to try to send a message and to ensure your security throughout this , as always : run a full node and store your coins at addresses to which * * only you have the private keys * * ; speak out against segwit2x ; write to the segwit2x supporters to let them know they are making a mistake and that they do not have your support .",78072a,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508678973,logical,5,0,8354,10178,0

"apologies for the length of this , which i 've posted before. you ca n't really understand 2x without this background . bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve bitcoin ( segwit - it increases capacity &amp ; makes a bunch of new features easy to implement ) . unbeknown to those devs , this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient ( which equals more profit ) . this same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule bitcoin. he was putting tens of millions into infrastructure , unlike users/devs/etc , and could n't understand why he was n't consequently in charge of the whole system . he hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of segwit , a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure , and installing himself as king. he met with some bitcoin devs in hong kong , agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1mb to 2mb blocks. under this proposal , segwit would be a soft fork , and the 2mb bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. the devs began coding for segwit , but support for the 2mb hard fork was absent ( the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2mb blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself ) . the miner , rich on his secretly buffed profits , embarked on a spending spree. he bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the bitcoin ecosystem ( who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions ) . he also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin , and who also long for bitcoin to acquire a ruling class . angered by the community 's refusal to accede to his 2mb fork , and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff , the miner came out against segwit ( which had been designed to be activated by the miners ) . together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support ( there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there 's actual billions at stake remember ) . some useful idiots , unable to see how bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen , were swept along. around 20 % of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner . with segwit still not implemented , one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named "" uasf "" ( or bip148 ) . it was well constructed , and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in new york , where they came up with "" segwit2x "" , a counter-plan to activate segwit 'on their terms ' , which is tied to a 2mb hard fork as per their previous scheme. the miner 's new plan was poorly conceived , widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit , install a ruling class , and prove the miners ' power in the face of the upstart ( from their perspective ) uasf . the uasf succeeded. to save face and inflict petulant damage on bitcoin , the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin ( bcash ) forked from bitcoin , marketed as 'the real bitcoin ' , and quickly rejected by users ( today it has the same number of tx in a day that bitcoin has in 10 minutes ) . but at least we now have segwit. to nobody 's great surprise , the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2mb part of their segwit2x plan , and that 's where we are today. they could easily fork from their own bcash chain in a far less dramatic way , but their current plan is to fork from bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way , which this analogy attempts to illustrate : imagine some sorcerer could have every american wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they 'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. seems great , but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too ( e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $ $ $ disappears also ) . additionally they 're so hard to distinguish from the real $ $ $ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other . all we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks , but people are scared easily , this shit 's complicated , and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already .",dopwj28,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508676057,Manticlops,1,0,147,4940,1

"&gt ; i 'm glad i 'm here , and this seat belt is buckled because we are going to experience some unthinkable returns in the next 3 years . before you get too excited , i 'd like to remind you that we are currently in the middle of a bubble . bubbles have to pop , which means we are impending on a bear market. the last bubble that popped began a ~ two year long bear market ( that was a fun one ) . i think it 's a toss up on whether or not the market is truly starting to elongate in terms of growth , but considering this bull market is also getting close to lasting two years , i would n't be surprised if that 's the way things turned out . just my opinion : i do n't think we 've quite hit the recognition we 'd need in order to see mass adoption , so another two year long bear market ( or even longer ) following this bubble is , personally , what i 'm expecting .",dopb9f4,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508633199,labellvie,1,0,949,242,0
"as much as i feel affection for a fellow cool-aid drinker , you 're wrong on pretty much every account . there is still more friction to initially enter the btc market. to enter equities , you have to go to an online broker , enter your personal and bank information , wait 1-3 days , and begin trading with a click. for the majority of btc users , this process is basically identical. they sign up for the most popular exchange in the same way they sign up for a e-broker. but they also have to do a bit of learning about wallents and whatnot. and since there is currently no "" e-trade "" company that they see on television , the learning process involves considerable friction and uncertainty. btc will one day win in this category , but it is not yet there . even if you were right about the friction issue , it still would n't be the reason btc will be the "" premier "" investment vehicle in 3 years. the biggest reason people pick a certain investment is because of its superior risk/reward , not how easy it is to buy. people will go to extraordinary lengths to make money. a little entry friction is not the main concern . i agree with you that it will experience massive growth while becoming an integral part of the world economy in a short time frame. but it will reach an equilibrium faster than any other asset class before. it wo n't grow forever. its market cap will reach a certain point , and then it will act more or less exactly like cash. it will be a store of value to be held while looking for stocks to buy .",doph7ve,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508640900,MFJones1,1,0,135,1493,0

"i posted that on the daily thread , but i just wanted to get this rant off my chest and maybe some of you answer or read this here . so many people here only complaining and complaining about "" bitcoin community is so toxic "" , "" upcoming fork doesn ´ t bring free money "" , "" bitcoin has way more recognition and hype "" and "" ethereum is so much better than bitcoin "" and whatever it is and predicting prices and doing trendlines and stuff. so what ? this all looks no different than politics to me. "" hey we are the ethereum party , and look at what bitcoin party does wrong , and how their party is full of toxic people. "" maybe we should slowly start thinking about a different approach ? maybe we could start to actively promote the advantages of ethereum without comparing it to bitcoin at all ? instead of complaining that bitcoin has "" the first mover advantage "" and the "" hype is only about bitcoin "" , try to take an active role and do what you can to create some hype for ethereum. but not a fake hype. or hype on facts and stuff that is actually possible , and already happening as of today . example : probably some of you and your friends travel / take the plane to your holiday destination from time to time. go and send this nice and easy to understand fizzy video from axa to some people you might know to show them the advantages of blockchain technology and ethereum. you don ´ t even need to mention bitcoin at all . here ´ s the link btw : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = xjzulz_-cmi all this bitcoin-shaming is doing , is making ethereum look bad. tell them that once pos gets released ( and the pos/pow hybrid will be here way sooner than everybody thinks , if you go and look at the dev meeting , which took place yesterday btw ) that each and every one of them can actually benefit from this new technology and contributing to the success and the stability of the network . and stop caring about the price damn. if you all care so much about the price , then you have ignored rule 1-10 of investing , where each rule says : "" don ´ t invest more than you can afford to lose "" . imagine that amount of money you put into ethereum being set on fire. could you still sleep well at night ? if the answer is no , then you care way too much about the price . let me add more to this. maybe we could also collectively start and promote and support actual projects with actual use cases and a team who stands behind their project no matter what. first we could take like 10 minutes of our time , and read the whitepaper of the project or whatever it is and get your own opinion. then we wouldn ´ t have to deal with scammers , who cash out their funds all the time or other scammers who pay for google ads to lure people into sending eth to the wrong ico address ( looking at you damn enjin-scammers who got at least 150.000 $ by posting a fake address via google ads ) . sure it ´ s the people ´ s own fault , but it happened and we shouldn ´ t have to deal with that . just yesterday i watched a 1 : 20hr livestream of one project you all might know , which will release soon a very important project - in my opinion - which is rather huge for mass adoption to make it easier to buy and sell ens names - name bazaar. nobody would need a crappy 0x address and scammers would have it a lot harder to scam people , if more ico ´ s would make use of an official ico address ( well done request btw who did exactly that ) . btw that would be another thing where eth is in an advantage position compared to btc which doesn ´ t have that feature ( at least that i know of ) . so back to that livestream. you know how many people watched that ? when i watched we were 10 people. 10. people. 10 people interested in ens , and the project behind that , and other projects of that team. another example : on friday the eth devs had dev meeting. vitalik spoke about pos/pow hybrid being implemented so damn soon. you know how many people watched that live stream ? where you could hear the actual developers talking about the current state of eth instead of listening to some useless fud in this subreddit ? it wasn ´ t even 200 people iirc. ethtrader subreddit has almost 100k subscribers. only 200 took the time to actually listen to what is going on with eth. sad . pathetic if you ask me. instead so many of you go into daily thread , complain about btc rising up and getting hyped and so on and so forth and complaining and complaining all day long if eth doesn ´ t go to moon while another coin does. yet you don ´ t even care about the real projects , which will bring real adoption and don ´ t support the devs and actually listen to facts instead of this crazy fud on here all the time . my 2 cents , bring the downvotes , maybe at least some of you read this . yes i own eth , omg , dnt , fun , mth and req. no i don ´ t own btc but i have been in the crypto space since 2013 , where i bought my first bitcoin for 120 € . edit : oh and btw don ´ t ever forget something else - so many things which are way more important than making money and loosing money and caring about which shitcoin is going to blow up in the next days and why btc rises while eth doesn ´ t. friends and family might be one of those things . edit 2 : thanks for reddit gold kind stranger ! just pm me to say thank you to you personally and maybe you could give me some feedback on why you gilded me : d !",77u0hl,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508599797,juststyle,46,0,741,1081,1

"apologies for the length of this , which i 've posted before. you ca n't really understand 2x without this background . bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve bitcoin ( segwit - it increases capacity &amp ; makes a bunch of new features easy to implement ) . unbeknown to those devs , this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient ( which equals more profit ) . this same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule bitcoin. he was putting tens of millions into infrastructure , unlike users/devs/etc , and could n't understand why he was n't consequently in charge of the whole system . he hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of segwit , a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure , and installing himself as king. he met with some bitcoin devs in hong kong , agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1mb to 2mb blocks. under this proposal , segwit would be a soft fork , and the 2mb bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. the devs began coding for segwit , but support for the 2mb hard fork was absent ( the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2mb blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself ) . the miner , rich on his secretly buffed profits , embarked on a spending spree. he bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the bitcoin ecosystem ( who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions ) . he also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin , and who also long for bitcoin to acquire a ruling class . angered by the community 's refusal to accede to his 2mb fork , and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff , the miner came out against segwit ( which had been designed to be activated by the miners ) . together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support ( there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there 's actual billions at stake remember ) . some useful idiots , unable to see how bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen , were swept along. around 20 % of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner . with segwit still not implemented , one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named "" uasf "" ( or bip148 ) . it was well constructed , and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in new york , where they came up with "" segwit2x "" , a counter-plan to activate segwit 'on their terms ' , which is tied to a 2mb hard fork as per their previous scheme. the miner 's new plan was poorly conceived , widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit , install a ruling class , and prove the miners ' power in the face of the upstart ( from their perspective ) uasf . the uasf succeeded. to save face and inflict petulant damage on bitcoin , the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin ( bcash ) forked from bitcoin , marketed as 'the real bitcoin ' , and quickly rejected by users ( today it has the same number of tx in a day that bitcoin has in 10 minutes ) . but at least we now have segwit. to nobody 's great surprise , the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2mb part of their segwit2x plan , and that 's where we are today. they could easily fork from their own bcash chain in a far less dramatic way , but their current plan is to fork from bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way , which this analogy attempts to illustrate : imagine some sorcerer could have every american wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they 'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. seems great , but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too ( e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $ $ $ disappears also ) . additionally they 're so hard to distinguish from the real $ $ $ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other . all we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks , but people are scared easily , this shit 's complicated , and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already .",dopwj28,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508676057,Manticlops,1,0,147,4940,1

"as i 'm becoming increasingly worried about icos ( full of flippers , pre-sale discounted prices , no mvp , random team , hardcap raised without any justifications , etc. ) , i decided to write some points that could maybe help you before investing in an ico , especially if you are new here . 1. product before everything. you must definitely focus on product before everything else. i 'm not the first to say that i know , but really , this point is so important. have you ever seen a start-up raising 40m $ without being able to show a minimum viable product ? no , because this has nonsense. just look at start-ups that you know in your city. when start-ups are raising like 500k $ ( which is absolutely nothing in the ico world ) , they have already a working product with customers. words as "" decentralized blablablah "" , marketing and communication are great but development is the crux . 2. community before hype. always be suspicious when an ico is hyped as fuck , hype attracts flippers. to succeed , a project needs a real long-term community. community members will be the first users and will help to improve the product. this is essential. of course hype can be great for the visibility of the project but do not forget this : hype is ephemeral , especially in crypto as everything is faster . 3. equity before bonus. you are probably not able to participate in pre-sales. before investing your money in an ico , you have to get informed about the pre-sales. a &gt ; 20 % bonus is totally insane and unfair. even below the ico price , whales will get a huge profit. for an institutional investor , as an hedge-fund for instance , a 20 % roi in 1 week is crazy as fuck comparing to the financial markets return on investment .",77umh6,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508605980,GatienCash,19,0,391,339,0

"we have been seeing ethereum follow bitcoin ’ s down trend more than its uptrend ( outside of the extreme rally earlier this year ) . it has me thinking during my commute. ethereum in my opinion ( outside of its additional functionality ) is an “ as good , if not better ” store of value. it ’ s underlying technology and security are extremely similar. i welcome anyone to disagree since there is lots of misinformation out there. i do n't see the advantages bitcoin has other than speculative interest . i think we take for granted what we know. we ’ re not “ smarter ” than others , we just have taken the time to understand our rational behind our investment. and many of us are technical or took the time to become so. that goes for guys in other crypto subreddits too. sure , you can point out shills , noobs , and strongly disagree with fans of other crypto ’ s. but i honestly don ’ t think any of this is driving the swings we ’ re seeing currently. and it ’ s scary to say , but i think these groups know more than a cnbc anchor talking about this stuff . i think there is an extremely high barrier of entry to the crypto space right now for the average person , and even those with lots of capital. we have the jp morgan ceo and media talking about “ bitcoin ” and making that term solely synonymous with “ cryptocurrency ” ( with exceptions , of course ) . ask an average person what cryptocurrency is and for the most part they will likely say bitcoin . i work for a large company and 3 c-level execs have talked to me about jamie dimon and bitcoin and blockchain. i was so surprised how much they are now following , and how much they didnt know about anything else in the space. we have college students who are interested in “ blockchain ” tech first , bitcoin second. we see hedge fund managers making large bets in bitcoin. these are the people that i think are dictating price now. yeah , we have whales fucking around , but look at the market cap of this space. money is pouring in and it ’ s not 20-30 something yr old crypto enthusiasts who were hodlers. new money is coming in. bitcoin right now seems to be the gateway drug , and for those smart enough who follow the rabbit hole will find it ’ s not superior . i have some bitcoin , i ’ m happy with the returns. but i view ethereum vs bitcoin now like i did with bitcoin in 2013 ( when i got in ) vs everything else – it ’ s better . all and all , bitcoin rise is good for the space , but it will take time for people to appreciate other aspects of cryptocurrency. it ’ s taken the general public to see bitcoin as it is now 8 years. i don ’ t think it will take that long for people to see ethereum , but don ’ t expect lambo ’ s or moon in the short term. just like bitcoin money was smart earlier on , ethereum money is smart now .",77pysd,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508542350,OneSmallStepForLambo,40,0,2442,1796,0

"hello everyone... i have been here since march and i would like to share what eth did for me in the last few months... it truly changed my life and i do n't think i will be able to express how grateful i am for stumbling upon this subreddit in march this year. i am posting from alt for obvious reasons . a little background about me : i am 21y and i come from a pretty much third world country. i knew since i was younger that the only way i could live decently was if i worked online , because unemployment in my country is huge problem and salaries are very low ( couple hundred dollars per month ) . since i was 15 i have been working online , social media marketing , web design , stuff like that. i was always doing pretty good but i knew that i had long way to go because i inherited absolutely nothing and i was in very tough situation , having to take care of my family in very early age . in march this year , i had couple thousand in my savings and i really wanted to buy a new car. i was looking for a car for weeks and could n't find one that i really wanted. i went to gym one morning and the guy in the gym asked me if i wanted to get into "" onecoin "" . i knew it was scam , so i said no , and of course , instantly googled it. i stumbled upon reddit thread that proved my doubts and i found monero subreddit by the accident. i thought it looked pretty interesting but i had no clue how can i invest so i kinda forgot about it. 2 weeks later i went back to monero subreddit and some guy linked /r/ethtrader in discussion. it was like 20-25 $ at the time. i spent some time trying to figure out how can i get in , and price jumped to 55 $ . i really wanted to wait for the dip , but hype was so big and it looked like price is going to explode again very soon. i went all in and after a month of holding price was 40 $ , and i bought at ~ 50 $ . i did n't care , and i started looking more at exchanges and other coins. i started trading and i was doing pretty alright... until i started investing icos and sometimes arbitraging between polo and bittrex during huge news. i started with small amounts and later i became so confident that i was making trades and arbitraging for 1-2 % with my whole portfolio. i was making thousands of dollars in like 1,2 hours and i could n't believe how easy it was. it was all possible because ethereum network was so fast at the time , literally few minutes and you have your coins on other exchange . in like a month or two i have increased amount of my eth by almost 600 % and eth went from 50 $ to 400 $ so the gains were insane . i went from having nothing except shitty old car to 6 figures in few weeks time. 2 months ago i decided to cash out a little more than half of my eth portfolio and i bought pretty much the best apartment in my town. i started selling at 380 $ but crash came pretty fast and i was selling until 190 $ , with avg ~ 260-280 $ per eth. i expect eth to be much higher in upcoming years but i just did n't feel good having everything in it. if something happens to me , at least my family will be taken care of and have roof under their heads . i stopped trading 3 months ago when exchanges and icos became too unreliable. at the beginning i was investing in every single ico and basically selling for 50-150 % profit within hours/days after it ended because people are fucking dumb and for some weird reason , they would be buying at insane prices on the first day. * remember bat and gnosis ( i did n't get into these two. i did n't trust gnosis at the time and bat ended too quickly ) . eth gave me financial independence , a freedom to live my life like i truly want... i can travel anywhere in the world , i do n't have to sell my time for money and i can use money to grow as person and help others around me . it also brought a lot of issues... at first i had huge problems - i did n't think i deserved this. i felt bad all the time , and i was so depressed because others around me worked so hard their whole lives and here i am suddenly having everything while they have nothing. it was really bad and i remember crying twice . also , a huge amount of people got jealous , even though i never talked about it or mention it to others... it is really hard when you see envy in some of your friends , and you start feeling like a shitty person for actually achieving something good . i do n't trade anymore , i lost probably 20-30k $ because of stuck withdrawals on liqui and polo , and i do n't trust anyone anymore. i do n't have so much eth like i did before , but i am holding it in hardware wallet which nobody can access except for me. i am looking forward next few years , and i hope that i will grow as person as much as this whole crypto thing. because it will change everything . i came from abroad a couple of days ago and i met a guy who worked for renewable energy company in the bar , and he was explaining me how are they going to use eth for providing energy to third world countries. he said that when people give money to charities to provide proper energy system , charity organization keeps like 70 % of the money and 30 % goes to the cause. with eth , 100 % will go to the cause. i did n't understand it very much and i still do n't , but it made me realize how unimportant these weekly price movements are , because he was so hyped up and he holds zero cryptocurrency so he is n't hoping to get rich , he is looking forward things that we are going to be able to do with this magical thing called ethereum . i am sorry for the long thread , and i know that it was a bit poorly written , but i had to get everything out of my head. i hope this inspires at least one person to work on themselves , their business and to invest money wisely , because it is very important to think long term. if i bought a car i wanted , none of this would be possible . thanks again you glorious bastards... this subreddit is n't as good as it was before , but i owe a lot to people here. the only thing that made me invest in eth and not monero at the time was daily discussions and spirit around here. i really wanted to be part of this community so i went for it. and i am so glad that i did .",780gtq,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508682256,blabla113,7,0,4,78,0

"# introduction i recently re-read the notes that i took on the book the black swan by nassim taleb , which can be found [ here ] ( https : //github.com/christopherdurr/booknotes/blob/master/blackswan.md ) . when i first read the black swan , it completely changed my viewpoint on how systems work and function. rereading my notes , i immediately realized that many of the principles from the black swan could be applied to the space of cryptocurrency today. in this post , i will use ideas from the black swan to analyze cryptocurrencies as a whole and hopefully allow you , the readers , to gain some more insight into systems not only behind cryptocurrency but also in systems in general . please note that in this article , when i use the word cryptocurrency i am also including blockchain technology within that definition . # our illusion of understanding as humans , we suffer from various mental biases that cause us to believe things that are not in fact true , especially when it comes to looking back at history. these three mental biases are : 1. the illusion of understanding , or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated ( or random ) than they realize 2. the retrospective distortion , or how we can assess matters only after the fact , as if they were in a rearview mirror 3. the overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people i believe that points one and two are the most salient for this discussion when it comes to cryptocurrency. the first point applies to when we believe we understand how the world works when in reality we do not. i find this especially prevalent when i attempt to explain to others how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work to other family-members and friends. to them , they believe digital currencies can not have any value because it is artificial. they believe they understand how money works , when in reality they suffer from the illusion of understanding . that 's not to say that those that understand the value of cryptocurrencies do n't also suffer from this mental bias. i am sure that i too have only an illusory understanding of cryptocurrency , and that in 10/20 years cryptocurrencies will be able to accomplish things that i had never even thought of before. take amazon , as an example , which when it started out only sold books. now you can buy practically anything on amazon with the mere click of a button. it would 've been difficult in the late 90 's to predict that amazon would go that route , and yet here we are. the same principle applies to cryptocurrency as well . the second point , regarding retrospective distortion , is also important because that 's what gives us the "" i knew it all along "" attitude. nassim taleb explains retrospective distortion by stating "" much of what took place would have been deemed completely crazy with respect to the past. yet it did not seem that crazy after the events. "" i believe that this will be the case for cryptocurrency as well. in 10/20 years , the same people who dismissed or did not understand cryptocurrencies will see it as an inevitability which was bound to happen. of course , when it comes to cryptocurrency the growth and adoption will become exponential. as taleb states -- * "" history and societies do not crawl. they jump "" . * i truly believe cryptocurrency will be that next jump in our society . # the turkey fallacy i believe that the turkey fallacy is the perfect example of our illusory understanding of the world. here is the story behind the fallacy : a turkey is selected by a family to be the turkey for thanksgiving. in order to prepare the turkey for the feast , the family begins to give the turkey extra food months before thanksgiving to make it extra plump. now , in the turkey 's view , he has it pretty good. he is consistently being fed more and more food. in fact , if the turkey assumes this will continue forever he 'll have a pretty good life. finally , on the day of thanksgiving , the family takes the turkey and kills it immediately to feast on it . the turkey fallacy is essentially this : things work until they do n't. what we learn from the past turns out to be either irrelevant or completely false , and at worst looking at the past as an example of the future can be incredibly misleading. this was no doubt the case with the turkey , and this will also be the case with cryptocurrency as well. a cryptocurrency in the top 20 marketcap , for example , may have a fatal security flaw and suddenly it becomes worthless. the best way to prevent this type of event from affecting you is by diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio . that unexpected event is what taleb calls a black swan , and it comes from the fact that explorers in the 14th century believed all swans were white. one day , however , they came upon a black swan and that worldview was shattered . black swans can be both positive and negative , but a key point to remember is that positive black swans take time to show their effect while negative black swans can happen very rapidly. this can no doubt be seen with cryptocurrencies as well. negative black swans , such as the dao hack , happened very rapidly and caused the price of ethereum to crater very quickly. meanwhile positive black swans , such as applications that can be built on ethereum , will generally take much longer to show their effects because it takes time for those positive events to occur . # confirming our worldview the major reason that people do not become aware of black swans is because people more often than not wish to confirm what they already believe , instead of what the truth actually is. if you look hard enough , it is easy to find sources that confirm what you believe to be true . unfortunately , this is the wrong way to view things. you should look at the evidence and then reach a hypothesis , instead of the other way around. as soon as you formulate a hypothesis , you should immediately try to find evidence to the contrary of your hypothesis to test it. ask yourself , "" what evidence would prove me wrong ? "" if you find evidence that goes against the validity of your hypothesis , then readjust your hypothesis. this type of thinking allows you to formulate well-structured , thorough hypotheses on things. this is especially important when it comes to cryptocurrency , as the field tends to learn towards complex hypotheses as opposed to simple ones. the world lends itself more to shades of grey as opposed to simple black-and-white viewpoints , which usually only serve as naive simplifications of complex issues . # why we ca n't predict black swans a key component of black swans is that they are highly asymmetrical in terms of consequences. if you look at bitcoin , for example , you will see what i mean. the rise in value of one bitcoin in the past 7 years was massive and , even for people who understood what bitcoin was capable of , would be nearly impossible to predict. other black swans , such as the dao hack , caused an extremely negative outlook for ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole . one can see why it would be useful to be able to predict a black swan -- after all , if we can see it coming then we can avoid its effects entirely. unfortunately , predicting black swans is nearly impossible. why ? because we have an innate bias to think we know more than we actually do. this is also known as * epistemic arrogance * , which is hubris concerning the limits of our own knowledge . the issue , too , is that people may acknowledge this fact but believe that experts in a field are somehow more capable of predicting these types of things than normal people. in fact , the more we view ourselves as an "" expert "" in a field the more our estimations become inaccurate in other fields : janitors and cabdrivers were able to make more significantly accurate predictions in random facts like the height of a building than harvard mbas . studies have shown that people who professionally make forecasts are especially prone to this type of mental bias. public price predictions of bitcoin that predict the price will reach [ $ 100,000 in 10 years ] ( http : //www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/bitcoin-price-forecast-hit-100000-in-10-years.html ) or even [ $ 1 billion ] ( https : //www.cryptocoinsnews.com/fox-business-speculates-bitcoin-price-reach-1-billion/ ) are more based on making sensational headlines and news stories than being based in reality. people who publicly state price predictions are usually incentivized to make outlandish claims because : 1. it makes for a good headline 2. it gives them the "" knew it all along "" if they turn out to be right. these people will be heralded as geniuses or market "" wizards "" 3. if they 're wrong , they can simply deflect questioning. most likely , the price prediction will be forgotten quickly anyway . when you perform incorrect predictions , you usually deflect in three ways : 1. you tell yourself that you were playing a different game entirely . 2. you invoke the outlier. i.e. "" that event was one in a million so there was no way to predict it ! "" 3. you use the "" almost right "" defense : you focus on the parts you got right , not the ones you got wrong . it 's also important to remember that sophisticated or complex methods of predicting events does not necessarily lead to more accurate forecasts than simpler methods . # tools and toys the most important advances we have in society are also the least predictable. bitcoin is a clear example of this. almost all advances in society are the direct result of a tool that was built. these tools can lead to unexpected effects and outcomes , which themselves can lead to even more unexpected outcomes. whatever tools lead to , they rarely are used exactly for what they were first intended for. facebook was originally exclusively for harvard students. taking a more outlandish example , play-doh was originally created because kroger wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper . "" we build toys. some of those toys change the world "" . the best way to get maximal exposure to positive black swans is to continue researching and gathering potential opportunities. it is important , however , that we do not use the past too often as a reference for what the future will be. too often , when we think of tomorrow we project it as just another yesterday. as the common saying goes , "" past performance is not indicative of future results. "" even if the past were somehow an indication of what is to come , we do not truly know much about the past either . it 's also important to distinguish between chaotic and random systems. random systems are completely random and do not have any predictable properties. chaotic systems , on the other hand , have predictable properties but are difficult to understand and know. lottery numbers are random , the price of a cryptocurrency is chaotic. being able to tell the difference between the two is key in discovering areas where you can find black swans . # how to maximize the effect of ( positive ) black swans now that you understand what black swans are and how difficult they are to detect , what can you do in order to increase the likelihood that you effected by a black swan ? you must maximize your serendipity. serendipity is defined as "" the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way "" . to maximize your serendipity , you must find instances where there are highly asymmetrical positive payouts ( e.g. bitcoin , other altcoins , etc. ) and increase your exposure to these instances as much as possible . when exposing yourself to these highly asymmetrical opportunities , you must do it in a number of different fields or areas in order to diversify serendipity while limiting your downside but maximizing your upside potential. let 's use another field besides cryptocurrency as an example of this : venture capital. let 's say that a venture capitalist invests $ 25k into 10 various startups one year after their founding , all of which could potentially have positive black swans. let 's say that 8/10 of those companies experience negative black swans and those go bankrupt. out of the two companies that 's left , one of them happens to break even and you make your money back but that 's it. unfortunately , you 're still $ 200k down. but what about the last company ? what if that last company you invested in were uber , or facebook ? suddenly that $ 25k could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars , more than making up for your other losses. the same principle applies with investing in cryptocurrency : you probably wo n't be able to pick exactly the next big winner , but you could probably diversify among 10 different coins that could have positive black swans in the future . it is usually futile to exactly predict black swans , as usually what occurs is reading the signal as the noise and over-interpreting data. instead , it is recommended that you instead spend your time looking for areas where there is a strong possibility a positive black swan could exist , even if you do n't know exactly what it is yet. seize anything that looks like an opportunity , because they are much , much rarer than you think. remember that to feel the effects of positive black swans , you must be exposed to them first . lastly , remember that usually there will be periods of calm and stability punctuated with massive change ( for better or for worse ) concentrated from a small number of black swans. those black swans are the ones to look out for , and the ones you least expect . ________________________________________________________ blatant self-promotion : i 'm working with www.solidified.io , a platform to have smart contracts audited quickly and efficiently by experts. are you looking to have your smart contract audited in 1/5th the time it takes our competitors ? sign up with our platform as a company. are you an expert dapp/ethereum developer looking to make money on the side ? signup as an expert today !",77xorq,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508639076,EnthusiastGrade,91,0,2063,2453,0
"basically if you 're in the crypto game you should read the black swan. in fact , you should read it anyway , it is not only informative ( he tackles statistics of extremes in a very accessible way ) , but a great read. he has other books in the series too . my interpretation from a financial point of view is that it may ultimately be more fruitful to lose a "" small "" amount of money on a more continuous basis putting it into investments or projects that could explode ( i.e. black swans ) . on the other hand , the more conventional route of putting money in steady market-based investments is actually daft , because all you 're doing is exposing your wealth to massive downsides ( i.e. predicable and periodic market crashes ) with zero chance of disproportionate growth ( i.e. order of magnitude , not a few % ) .",dopidzy,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508642453,timmerwb,13,0,15,761,0

"i posted that on the daily thread , but i just wanted to get this rant off my chest and maybe some of you answer or read this here . so many people here only complaining and complaining about "" bitcoin community is so toxic "" , "" upcoming fork doesn ´ t bring free money "" , "" bitcoin has way more recognition and hype "" and "" ethereum is so much better than bitcoin "" and whatever it is and predicting prices and doing trendlines and stuff. so what ? this all looks no different than politics to me. "" hey we are the ethereum party , and look at what bitcoin party does wrong , and how their party is full of toxic people. "" maybe we should slowly start thinking about a different approach ? maybe we could start to actively promote the advantages of ethereum without comparing it to bitcoin at all ? instead of complaining that bitcoin has "" the first mover advantage "" and the "" hype is only about bitcoin "" , try to take an active role and do what you can to create some hype for ethereum. but not a fake hype. or hype on facts and stuff that is actually possible , and already happening as of today . example : probably some of you and your friends travel / take the plane to your holiday destination from time to time. go and send this nice and easy to understand fizzy video from axa to some people you might know to show them the advantages of blockchain technology and ethereum. you don ´ t even need to mention bitcoin at all . here ´ s the link btw : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = xjzulz_-cmi all this bitcoin-shaming is doing , is making ethereum look bad. tell them that once pos gets released ( and the pos/pow hybrid will be here way sooner than everybody thinks , if you go and look at the dev meeting , which took place yesterday btw ) that each and every one of them can actually benefit from this new technology and contributing to the success and the stability of the network . and stop caring about the price damn. if you all care so much about the price , then you have ignored rule 1-10 of investing , where each rule says : "" don ´ t invest more than you can afford to lose "" . imagine that amount of money you put into ethereum being set on fire. could you still sleep well at night ? if the answer is no , then you care way too much about the price . let me add more to this. maybe we could also collectively start and promote and support actual projects with actual use cases and a team who stands behind their project no matter what. first we could take like 10 minutes of our time , and read the whitepaper of the project or whatever it is and get your own opinion. then we wouldn ´ t have to deal with scammers , who cash out their funds all the time or other scammers who pay for google ads to lure people into sending eth to the wrong ico address ( looking at you damn enjin-scammers who got at least 150.000 $ by posting a fake address via google ads ) . sure it ´ s the people ´ s own fault , but it happened and we shouldn ´ t have to deal with that . just yesterday i watched a 1 : 20hr livestream of one project you all might know , which will release soon a very important project - in my opinion - which is rather huge for mass adoption to make it easier to buy and sell ens names - name bazaar. nobody would need a crappy 0x address and scammers would have it a lot harder to scam people , if more ico ´ s would make use of an official ico address ( well done request btw who did exactly that ) . btw that would be another thing where eth is in an advantage position compared to btc which doesn ´ t have that feature ( at least that i know of ) . so back to that livestream. you know how many people watched that ? when i watched we were 10 people. 10. people. 10 people interested in ens , and the project behind that , and other projects of that team. another example : on friday the eth devs had dev meeting. vitalik spoke about pos/pow hybrid being implemented so damn soon. you know how many people watched that live stream ? where you could hear the actual developers talking about the current state of eth instead of listening to some useless fud in this subreddit ? it wasn ´ t even 200 people iirc. ethtrader subreddit has almost 100k subscribers. only 200 took the time to actually listen to what is going on with eth. sad . pathetic if you ask me. instead so many of you go into daily thread , complain about btc rising up and getting hyped and so on and so forth and complaining and complaining all day long if eth doesn ´ t go to moon while another coin does. yet you don ´ t even care about the real projects , which will bring real adoption and don ´ t support the devs and actually listen to facts instead of this crazy fud on here all the time . my 2 cents , bring the downvotes , maybe at least some of you read this . yes i own eth , omg , dnt , fun , mth and req. no i don ´ t own btc but i have been in the crypto space since 2013 , where i bought my first bitcoin for 120 € . edit : oh and btw don ´ t ever forget something else - so many things which are way more important than making money and loosing money and caring about which shitcoin is going to blow up in the next days and why btc rises while eth doesn ´ t. friends and family might be one of those things . edit 2 : thanks for reddit gold kind stranger ! just pm me to say thank you to you personally and maybe you could give me some feedback on why you gilded me : d !",77u0hl,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508599797,juststyle,46,0,741,1081,1

"as i 'm becoming increasingly worried about icos ( full of flippers , pre-sale discounted prices , no mvp , random team , hardcap raised without any justifications , etc. ) , i decided to write some points that could maybe help you before investing in an ico , especially if you are new here . 1. product before everything. you must definitely focus on product before everything else. i 'm not the first to say that i know , but really , this point is so important. have you ever seen a start-up raising 40m $ without being able to show a minimum viable product ? no , because this has nonsense. just look at start-ups that you know in your city. when start-ups are raising like 500k $ ( which is absolutely nothing in the ico world ) , they have already a working product with customers. words as "" decentralized blablablah "" , marketing and communication are great but development is the crux . 2. community before hype. always be suspicious when an ico is hyped as fuck , hype attracts flippers. to succeed , a project needs a real long-term community. community members will be the first users and will help to improve the product. this is essential. of course hype can be great for the visibility of the project but do not forget this : hype is ephemeral , especially in crypto as everything is faster . 3. equity before bonus. you are probably not able to participate in pre-sales. before investing your money in an ico , you have to get informed about the pre-sales. a &gt ; 20 % bonus is totally insane and unfair. even below the ico price , whales will get a huge profit. for an institutional investor , as an hedge-fund for instance , a 20 % roi in 1 week is crazy as fuck comparing to the financial markets return on investment .",77umh6,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508605980,GatienCash,22,0,391,339,0

"we have been seeing ethereum follow bitcoin ’ s down trend more than its uptrend ( outside of the extreme rally earlier this year ) . it has me thinking during my commute. ethereum in my opinion ( outside of its additional functionality ) is an “ as good , if not better ” store of value. it ’ s underlying technology and security are extremely similar. i welcome anyone to disagree since there is lots of misinformation out there. i do n't see the advantages bitcoin has other than speculative interest . i think we take for granted what we know. we ’ re not “ smarter ” than others , we just have taken the time to understand our rational behind our investment. and many of us are technical or took the time to become so. that goes for guys in other crypto subreddits too. sure , you can point out shills , noobs , and strongly disagree with fans of other crypto ’ s. but i honestly don ’ t think any of this is driving the swings we ’ re seeing currently. and it ’ s scary to say , but i think these groups know more than a cnbc anchor talking about this stuff . i think there is an extremely high barrier of entry to the crypto space right now for the average person , and even those with lots of capital. we have the jp morgan ceo and media talking about “ bitcoin ” and making that term solely synonymous with “ cryptocurrency ” ( with exceptions , of course ) . ask an average person what cryptocurrency is and for the most part they will likely say bitcoin . i work for a large company and 3 c-level execs have talked to me about jamie dimon and bitcoin and blockchain. i was so surprised how much they are now following , and how much they didnt know about anything else in the space. we have college students who are interested in “ blockchain ” tech first , bitcoin second. we see hedge fund managers making large bets in bitcoin. these are the people that i think are dictating price now. yeah , we have whales fucking around , but look at the market cap of this space. money is pouring in and it ’ s not 20-30 something yr old crypto enthusiasts who were hodlers. new money is coming in. bitcoin right now seems to be the gateway drug , and for those smart enough who follow the rabbit hole will find it ’ s not superior . i have some bitcoin , i ’ m happy with the returns. but i view ethereum vs bitcoin now like i did with bitcoin in 2013 ( when i got in ) vs everything else – it ’ s better . all and all , bitcoin rise is good for the space , but it will take time for people to appreciate other aspects of cryptocurrency. it ’ s taken the general public to see bitcoin as it is now 8 years. i don ’ t think it will take that long for people to see ethereum , but don ’ t expect lambo ’ s or moon in the short term. just like bitcoin money was smart earlier on , ethereum money is smart now .",77pysd,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508542350,OneSmallStepForLambo,44,0,2442,1796,0

"# introduction i recently re-read the notes that i took on the book the black swan by nassim taleb , which can be found [ here ] ( https : //github.com/christopherdurr/booknotes/blob/master/blackswan.md ) . when i first read the black swan , it completely changed my viewpoint on how systems work and function. rereading my notes , i immediately realized that many of the principles from the black swan could be applied to the space of cryptocurrency today. in this post , i will use ideas from the black swan to analyze cryptocurrencies as a whole and hopefully allow you , the readers , to gain some more insight into systems not only behind cryptocurrency but also in systems in general . please note that in this article , when i use the word cryptocurrency i am also including blockchain technology within that definition . # our illusion of understanding as humans , we suffer from various mental biases that cause us to believe things that are not in fact true , especially when it comes to looking back at history. these three mental biases are : 1. the illusion of understanding , or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated ( or random ) than they realize 2. the retrospective distortion , or how we can assess matters only after the fact , as if they were in a rearview mirror 3. the overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people i believe that points one and two are the most salient for this discussion when it comes to cryptocurrency. the first point applies to when we believe we understand how the world works when in reality we do not. i find this especially prevalent when i attempt to explain to others how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work to other family-members and friends. to them , they believe digital currencies can not have any value because it is artificial. they believe they understand how money works , when in reality they suffer from the illusion of understanding . that 's not to say that those that understand the value of cryptocurrencies do n't also suffer from this mental bias. i am sure that i too have only an illusory understanding of cryptocurrency , and that in 10/20 years cryptocurrencies will be able to accomplish things that i had never even thought of before. take amazon , as an example , which when it started out only sold books. now you can buy practically anything on amazon with the mere click of a button. it would 've been difficult in the late 90 's to predict that amazon would go that route , and yet here we are. the same principle applies to cryptocurrency as well . the second point , regarding retrospective distortion , is also important because that 's what gives us the "" i knew it all along "" attitude. nassim taleb explains retrospective distortion by stating "" much of what took place would have been deemed completely crazy with respect to the past. yet it did not seem that crazy after the events. "" i believe that this will be the case for cryptocurrency as well. in 10/20 years , the same people who dismissed or did not understand cryptocurrencies will see it as an inevitability which was bound to happen. of course , when it comes to cryptocurrency the growth and adoption will become exponential. as taleb states -- * "" history and societies do not crawl. they jump "" . * i truly believe cryptocurrency will be that next jump in our society . # the turkey fallacy i believe that the turkey fallacy is the perfect example of our illusory understanding of the world. here is the story behind the fallacy : a turkey is selected by a family to be the turkey for thanksgiving. in order to prepare the turkey for the feast , the family begins to give the turkey extra food months before thanksgiving to make it extra plump. now , in the turkey 's view , he has it pretty good. he is consistently being fed more and more food. in fact , if the turkey assumes this will continue forever he 'll have a pretty good life. finally , on the day of thanksgiving , the family takes the turkey and kills it immediately to feast on it . the turkey fallacy is essentially this : things work until they do n't. what we learn from the past turns out to be either irrelevant or completely false , and at worst looking at the past as an example of the future can be incredibly misleading. this was no doubt the case with the turkey , and this will also be the case with cryptocurrency as well. a cryptocurrency in the top 20 marketcap , for example , may have a fatal security flaw and suddenly it becomes worthless. the best way to prevent this type of event from affecting you is by diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio . that unexpected event is what taleb calls a black swan , and it comes from the fact that explorers in the 14th century believed all swans were white. one day , however , they came upon a black swan and that worldview was shattered . black swans can be both positive and negative , but a key point to remember is that positive black swans take time to show their effect while negative black swans can happen very rapidly. this can no doubt be seen with cryptocurrencies as well. negative black swans , such as the dao hack , happened very rapidly and caused the price of ethereum to crater very quickly. meanwhile positive black swans , such as applications that can be built on ethereum , will generally take much longer to show their effects because it takes time for those positive events to occur . # confirming our worldview the major reason that people do not become aware of black swans is because people more often than not wish to confirm what they already believe , instead of what the truth actually is. if you look hard enough , it is easy to find sources that confirm what you believe to be true . unfortunately , this is the wrong way to view things. you should look at the evidence and then reach a hypothesis , instead of the other way around. as soon as you formulate a hypothesis , you should immediately try to find evidence to the contrary of your hypothesis to test it. ask yourself , "" what evidence would prove me wrong ? "" if you find evidence that goes against the validity of your hypothesis , then readjust your hypothesis. this type of thinking allows you to formulate well-structured , thorough hypotheses on things. this is especially important when it comes to cryptocurrency , as the field tends to learn towards complex hypotheses as opposed to simple ones. the world lends itself more to shades of grey as opposed to simple black-and-white viewpoints , which usually only serve as naive simplifications of complex issues . # why we ca n't predict black swans a key component of black swans is that they are highly asymmetrical in terms of consequences. if you look at bitcoin , for example , you will see what i mean. the rise in value of one bitcoin in the past 7 years was massive and , even for people who understood what bitcoin was capable of , would be nearly impossible to predict. other black swans , such as the dao hack , caused an extremely negative outlook for ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole . one can see why it would be useful to be able to predict a black swan -- after all , if we can see it coming then we can avoid its effects entirely. unfortunately , predicting black swans is nearly impossible. why ? because we have an innate bias to think we know more than we actually do. this is also known as * epistemic arrogance * , which is hubris concerning the limits of our own knowledge . the issue , too , is that people may acknowledge this fact but believe that experts in a field are somehow more capable of predicting these types of things than normal people. in fact , the more we view ourselves as an "" expert "" in a field the more our estimations become inaccurate in other fields : janitors and cabdrivers were able to make more significantly accurate predictions in random facts like the height of a building than harvard mbas . studies have shown that people who professionally make forecasts are especially prone to this type of mental bias. public price predictions of bitcoin that predict the price will reach [ $ 100,000 in 10 years ] ( http : //www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/bitcoin-price-forecast-hit-100000-in-10-years.html ) or even [ $ 1 billion ] ( https : //www.cryptocoinsnews.com/fox-business-speculates-bitcoin-price-reach-1-billion/ ) are more based on making sensational headlines and news stories than being based in reality. people who publicly state price predictions are usually incentivized to make outlandish claims because : 1. it makes for a good headline 2. it gives them the "" knew it all along "" if they turn out to be right. these people will be heralded as geniuses or market "" wizards "" 3. if they 're wrong , they can simply deflect questioning. most likely , the price prediction will be forgotten quickly anyway . when you perform incorrect predictions , you usually deflect in three ways : 1. you tell yourself that you were playing a different game entirely . 2. you invoke the outlier. i.e. "" that event was one in a million so there was no way to predict it ! "" 3. you use the "" almost right "" defense : you focus on the parts you got right , not the ones you got wrong . it 's also important to remember that sophisticated or complex methods of predicting events does not necessarily lead to more accurate forecasts than simpler methods . # tools and toys the most important advances we have in society are also the least predictable. bitcoin is a clear example of this. almost all advances in society are the direct result of a tool that was built. these tools can lead to unexpected effects and outcomes , which themselves can lead to even more unexpected outcomes. whatever tools lead to , they rarely are used exactly for what they were first intended for. facebook was originally exclusively for harvard students. taking a more outlandish example , play-doh was originally created because kroger wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper . "" we build toys. some of those toys change the world "" . the best way to get maximal exposure to positive black swans is to continue researching and gathering potential opportunities. it is important , however , that we do not use the past too often as a reference for what the future will be. too often , when we think of tomorrow we project it as just another yesterday. as the common saying goes , "" past performance is not indicative of future results. "" even if the past were somehow an indication of what is to come , we do not truly know much about the past either . it 's also important to distinguish between chaotic and random systems. random systems are completely random and do not have any predictable properties. chaotic systems , on the other hand , have predictable properties but are difficult to understand and know. lottery numbers are random , the price of a cryptocurrency is chaotic. being able to tell the difference between the two is key in discovering areas where you can find black swans . # how to maximize the effect of ( positive ) black swans now that you understand what black swans are and how difficult they are to detect , what can you do in order to increase the likelihood that you effected by a black swan ? you must maximize your serendipity. serendipity is defined as "" the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way "" . to maximize your serendipity , you must find instances where there are highly asymmetrical positive payouts ( e.g. bitcoin , other altcoins , etc. ) and increase your exposure to these instances as much as possible . when exposing yourself to these highly asymmetrical opportunities , you must do it in a number of different fields or areas in order to diversify serendipity while limiting your downside but maximizing your upside potential. let 's use another field besides cryptocurrency as an example of this : venture capital. let 's say that a venture capitalist invests $ 25k into 10 various startups one year after their founding , all of which could potentially have positive black swans. let 's say that 8/10 of those companies experience negative black swans and those go bankrupt. out of the two companies that 's left , one of them happens to break even and you make your money back but that 's it. unfortunately , you 're still $ 200k down. but what about the last company ? what if that last company you invested in were uber , or facebook ? suddenly that $ 25k could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars , more than making up for your other losses. the same principle applies with investing in cryptocurrency : you probably wo n't be able to pick exactly the next big winner , but you could probably diversify among 10 different coins that could have positive black swans in the future . it is usually futile to exactly predict black swans , as usually what occurs is reading the signal as the noise and over-interpreting data. instead , it is recommended that you instead spend your time looking for areas where there is a strong possibility a positive black swan could exist , even if you do n't know exactly what it is yet. seize anything that looks like an opportunity , because they are much , much rarer than you think. remember that to feel the effects of positive black swans , you must be exposed to them first . lastly , remember that usually there will be periods of calm and stability punctuated with massive change ( for better or for worse ) concentrated from a small number of black swans. those black swans are the ones to look out for , and the ones you least expect . ________________________________________________________ blatant self-promotion : i 'm working with www.solidified.io , a platform to have smart contracts audited quickly and efficiently by experts. are you looking to have your smart contract audited in 1/5th the time it takes our competitors ? sign up with our platform as a company. are you an expert dapp/ethereum developer looking to make money on the side ? signup as an expert today !",77xorq,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508639076,EnthusiastGrade,89,0,2063,2453,0
"basically if you 're in the crypto game you should read the black swan. in fact , you should read it anyway , it is not only informative ( he tackles statistics of extremes in a very accessible way ) , but a great read. he has other books in the series too . my interpretation from a financial point of view is that it may ultimately be more fruitful to lose a "" small "" amount of money on a more continuous basis putting it into investments or projects that could explode ( i.e. black swans ) . on the other hand , the more conventional route of putting money in steady market-based investments is actually daft , because all you 're doing is exposing your wealth to massive downsides ( i.e. predicable and periodic market crashes ) with zero chance of disproportionate growth ( i.e. order of magnitude , not a few % ) .",dopidzy,ethtrader,ethtrader,1508642453,timmerwb,12,0,15,761,0

"i first heard about bitcoin in 2014. i had just finished school and started my first job as a dev at a tech consulting company where some of my coworkers started to mention it. i didn ’ t really pay much attention to it and didn ’ t fully understand it ( kicking myself now... hindsight is always 20/20 ) . a lot of people ignored them ( myself included ) and i never really thought about it again until very recently . i like to play poker online and recently won a pretty large tourney with a very nice payout. i was very uncomfortable with having all that money on my poker site account so i looked into options for cashing out. bitcoin was one of the options and it didn ’ t have any fees associated with it so i decided what the heck , may as well look into it. i read a few posts explaining how to setup coinbase and a bitcoin wallet so i did both of those and before i really knew what was going on i had about 1 full bitcoin on coinbase ready to be transferred back to my bank account . i was super busy and didn ’ t know how long it was gon na take to transfer so i kinda just left it there for a few days and when i checked it again i was absolutely shocked at how much more it was worth ! i was expecting it to be very close to the amount of money i won from the tourney ( maybe $ 10 fluctuation ) but holy shit was i wrong , when i looked it had jumped almost $ 600... i was baffled &amp ; hooked at the same time . so naturally i started educating myself about all things bitcoin wondering why the price was going so high ( obviously nobody knows that ) but i did learn about what bitcoin represents and why people want to use it. i ’ ve been absolutely hooked ever since and have become addicted to reading this sub and learning more about it ! i just found out about the roller coaster guy and check him all the time now hahah it ’ s great ! i have educated myself a lot in the last few days and even got a hardware wallet ( trezor ) to store my coins before the hard fork. in addition to my poker winnings i made another additional investment because i really believe in everything that bitcoin stands for and just thought i ’ d share my journey on how i got here . see you on the moon !",77yq6y,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508653624,Jam0909,43,0,30,1,0

"congratulations ! now it is time to think of a few important points . * read about the [ kelly criterion ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kelly_criterion ) . shortened and simplified : do not keep all your eggs in one basket. spread the risk of losses. diversify in every respect. have at least two trezor or similar hardware wallets and several safe backups for each. the worst you could possibly do is keep all your bitcoins on one exchange or , maybe worse , on one windows computer. think of mtgox and all the other exchanges that squandered clients ' money . * compared to the fundamentals , bitcoin looks a bit shakey right now , with hard forks and other problems looming that may or may not cause trouble. and the price is high. consider selling some to be on the safe side just in case. do n't be steered by greed for ever more. trees do not grow into heaven. do n't forget that it is always possible that the bitcoin price suddenly goes to zero. you do not want to lose everything if that happens. trade some of your bitcoins for gold. ( vaultoro comes to mind. ) even if you spend half of your bitcoins , the other half will make up for it if the price doubles again . * ask a tax consultant. if your bitcoin wealth is currently not known to anybody , you would ( a ) be a criminal and also ( b ) have a high risk of attracting attention when you eventually begin to sell. on the other hand , if you held them long enough , the tax laws of your country may tax you lightly ( us ) or not at all ( germany ) , provided that you have proof of long-term holding. i repeat : ask a tax consultant .",doprc6k,bitcoin,bitcoin,1508661429,hgmichna,1,0,1518,2352,0
